## Set Up Tutorial

TODO: Write out in a tutorial format the steps you took to set up your robot. This might include build instructions, installation steps, or both.

## Implementation Details

TODO: For the robotic system your team worked on, provide details of the created implementation. First, state the overall functionality of your implementation. Then, describe the application or a scenario to which the implemented was targeted. Finally, discuss the technical details. Here, you may need to discuss specific packages you used or a particular approach you took in implementation. Please include references (links are okay) to all resources you have used.

## Experiments

TODO: Conduct at least 3 experiments with your completed solution, where something is varied in each experiment (for example changes in the environment). Produce visual representation of these experiments (pictures or videos of each experiment's scenario or a simulated map). Describe your observations of the outcome of these experiments (how did the robot behave in these experiments? were there variations?).

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

TODO: Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this assignment and describe the biggest learning takeaways.

## Team Work

TODO: Describe the details of your team working strategy, specifically explain how did you complete this work as a team and describe the specific contributions of each team member.
